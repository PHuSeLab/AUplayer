# AU Player
A simple Action Unit player with a rendered face modeled with Candide-3.  
The tool permits to plot [Action Units](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~face/facs.htm) values on a temporal basis and convert them in terms of AUV from the [Candide-3](http://www.icg.isy.liu.se/candide/) model, in order to show a 113-vertex based expression face.
